# Java and Object-Oriented Programming Lab

This repository contains the materials and instructions for the Java and Object-Oriented Programming lab conducted during the academic year 2023/2024 at the National Engineering School of Sousse.

## Environment Setup

- **Java Version:** Java 17
- **IDE:** NetBeans 16

Ensure that you have Java 17 installed on your system and have NetBeans 16 configured for Java development before starting the lab exercises.

## Lab Exercises

The lab exercises are designed to help students grasp the concepts of object-oriented programming using Java. Each exercise focuses on different aspects of OOP, ranging from basic concepts to more advanced topics.

### Session 1: Java, Netbeans, and Git Fundamentals

- **Objective:** Introduce students to the foundational concepts of Java programming, NetBeans IDE, and version control with Git.
- **Topics Covered:** Basic Java syntax, data types, variables, operators, control flow statements. NetBeans IDE features and usage. Introduction to version control with Git.
- **Instructions:** Complete Java program exercises in NetBeans, commit changes to a Git repository, and understand basic version control operations.

### Session 2: Object-Oriented Concepts (Objects and Classes)

- **Objective:** Build on foundational Java knowledge by delving into object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, focusing on classes and objects.
- **Topics Covered:** Object-oriented concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **Instructions:** Implement class hierarchies, define objects, explore inheritance and polymorphism, and understand the principles of encapsulation and abstraction.

### Session 3: String and File Handling in Java

- **Objective:** Expand students' understanding of Java programming by exploring string manipulation and file handling.
- **Topics Covered:** String manipulation techniques, file input/output operations in Java.
- **Instructions:** Practice working with strings, reading from and writing to files, and handling various file-related operations in Java programs.

### Session 4: Advanced OOP (Polymorphism), Enumeration, and Java Annotation (Lombok Example)

- **Objective:** Enhance students' comprehension and application of polymorphism, introduce enumeration, and demonstrate the use of Java annotations with Lombok.
- **Topics Covered:** Advanced concepts in polymorphism, enumeration, Java annotations with Lombok.
- **Instructions:** Implement advanced polymorphic behavior, explore enumeration for defining constants, and illustrate the usage of Java annotations with Lombok library for code generation tasks.

### Session 5: Abstract Classes vs Interfaces and Exception Handling

- **Objective:** Teach students how to handle exceptional situations in Java programs, explore advanced object-oriented concepts such as abstract classes, interfaces, and database communication in Java.
- **Topics Covered:** Differences between abstract classes and interfaces, exception handling mechanisms, try-catch blocks, custom exceptions.
- **Instructions:** Write Java programs that incorporate robust exception handling strategies and implement abstract classes and interfaces.

### Project: Design Patterns, Collections, and Database Communication 

- **Objective:** Apply learned concepts by working on a project involving design patterns, Java Collections Framework, and database communication.
- **Topics Covered:** Design pattern implementation, utilization of Java collections (lists, sets, maps), database interaction.
- **Instructions:** Design and implement a project that utilizes design patterns for scalability and maintainability, utilizes various data structures from the Java Collections Framework, and communicates with a database for data storage and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using PostgreSQL.
